# Leonardo Di Vittorio 

*Creative Developer in ❤️ with UX/UI*

I love starting projects from scratch, often described as *"highly creative"* by my co-workers. This means I can quickly turn ideas and designs into functioning code on both front and backend. 

I perform well in agile teams, trying to learn the most from my team members, so to grow faster.

Enthusiast about product and interior design, photography, editorial design, and everything that has a nice aesthetic.
