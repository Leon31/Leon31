# Hi! I'm Leonardo Di Vittorio.

I'm a Creative Frontend developer master in CSS, with a strong background in Graphic Design, who turned more than 300 junior developers into great programmers. Nice to meet you!

I consider myself a framework-agnostic. I had the chance to work with many different Frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Svelte often using TypeScript. I tend to investigate best practices and good patterns from each framework and see how they can be re-used in others to improve usability and maintainability. I'm particularly fond of React though!
I'm also very familiar with backend technologies like RESTfull or GraphQL servers or the different families of DataBases like SQL or its counterparts Mongo and Redis. 

My expertise with the JavaScript ecosystem led me to teach Advanced Frontend development techniques to 300+ developers. 
Teaching is what taught me the most. I had to figure out students' needs and always show up prepared. You need confidence and immagination to run a classroom of 40 students as well as empathy an patience to provide useful feedback. It takes passion to be a teacher!

I'm very confident with testing my code, mostly choosing a TDD approach, which greatly increases my development speed as I don't need to do it manually every time I modify some code. I try to leave every bit of code I touch more readable, modular, performant, and accessible than I found it.

I'm passionate about continuously improving my knowledge, I'm a fast learner who can find creative solutions to technical challenges. As I had to follow juniors in their projects I often functioned as the Team Leader giving directions and managing their skills to bring out the best in each of them.
